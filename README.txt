I attached the code, dataset  and manual how to prepare the dataset for training and test: 
They are named slightly differently when you unzip them but they are the correct training and testing datasets. What you need to do is go into the util_codes folder and run separate_photo_print.py and it will separate either dataset into a bunch of folders for print and photo fingers. After that you need to change the dataset locations inside of train_verif.py and test_verif_fingervsphoto.py to the new locations that seperate_photo_print.py placed the dataset into. Then you can run AutomateTests.py with appropriate parameters that you can set by putting them into the lists at the top of the AutomateTests.py file.
